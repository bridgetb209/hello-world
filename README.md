Just another repository
My name is Bridget. By nature, I am a designer. I thought that I was ready to give up that part of me but that does not seem to be the case. Knowing that now, I am embracing my strengths and working on my weaknesses. Every day I pray that I find my pathâ€”that thing that I can be passionate about even when it doesn't "feel" great.
